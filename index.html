    <p>
      Ferry Porsche's dream of the perfect sports car has always driven us - throughout our history. And every day we are getting closer to it. With every concept, every development and every model. Along the way, we follow a plan, an ideal that unites us all. We simply call it the Porsche principle.

        The soul has many aspects. It is variable and constantly changing. When viewing the Porsche Taycan, he reveals himself with a smile that expresses complete pleasure. Or for the desire for freedom behind the wheel of the new Taycan Cross Turismo that keeps its ground, even from everyday life.

        The perfect sports car for those who like to push the limits. For those who are more likely to ask "why not?" rather than "why?". For those who are serious about entertainment and prefer to sit in a sports chair rather than a leather chair.

        Can vision be logical? Is it allowed at all? Probably no. We believe that the more far-sighted the idea at the beginning, the more interesting it will be at the end. Then it's worth fighting for. So it was with the Panamera. Sports car for four? With impressive performance and great comfort? With typical Porsche

        Five doors, five places, but incompatible, unmistakable and unstoppable. In its latest generation, the Macan remains the sports car of compact SUVs. Instantly, Porsche's DNA is recognizable from the sloping roofline: the "FlyLine" lends the Macan its characteristic sporty car contours.

        Cayenne and Cayenne Coup√©: Both have striking looks and impressive performance, with up to five seats. Whether you'd rather embark on your next Cayenne adventure with friends or fall for iconic coupe lines, it's purely a matter of personal taste. But one thing also applies to our two major models: every Porsche is first and foremost a sports car.
